      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Shilly Riser, and I am a student at FrontEnd
        Simplified. I have a passion for technology and problem-solving, which
        has driven me to explore various aspects of computer science, including
        conding and programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy participating in sales,
        where I can collaborate with others and apply my skills to real-world
        challenges. Outside of academics, I have a keen interest in yoga and
        enjoy spending time with my family during my free time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to leverage my education and experiences to contribute to
        innovative projects in the tech industry, particularly in areas such as
        artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. I am excited about the
        opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to making a positive
        impact through technology.
